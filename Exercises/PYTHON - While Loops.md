### Exercise 2 (easy)

A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age . If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15 .

Take the last exercise, and apply it to a family, ask every member of the family their age, and at the end of the loop, tell them the cost of the tickets for the whole family.



### Exercise 4 (easy)

Given a list, use a while loop to print out every elements from the end to the beginning.



### Exercise 5 (medium)

Given a list, use a while loop to print out every element which his index is even.



### Exercise 6 (medium)

A group of teenagers is coming to your movie theater and want to see a movie that is restricted for people between 16 and 21 years old.

Write a program that ask every user their age, and then tell them which can see the movie.

>  Try to add the allowed ones to a list. 



### Exercise (medium)

This time you have a list of users, and you want to remove every user that is below 16 years old.

Write a program that ask every user their age, and if they are less than 16 years old, remove them from the list.

At the end, print the final list.

### Exercise (hard)

Make a list called `sandwich_orders` and fill it with the names of various sandwiches . 

Then make an empty list called `finished_sandwiches`. Loop through the list of sandwich orders and print a message for each order, such as `I made your tuna sandwich`. 

As each sandwich is made, move it to the list of finished sandwiches. 

After all the sandwiches have been made, print a message listing each sandwich that was made. 



### Exercise (hard)

Using the list `sandwich_orders` from Exercise 8, make sure the sandwich 'pastrami' appears in the list at least three times.

Add code near the beginning of your program to print a message saying the deli has run out of pastrami, and then use a `while` loop to remove all occurrences of 'pastrami' from sandwich_orders. 

Make sure no pastrami sandwiches end up in finished_sandwiches.



### Exercise (hard)

Encrypt and decrypt a string with Caesar cipher. 

Check on internet to understand how Caesar cipher works.



### Exercise (hard)

Create a python mastermind, make a program that asks the user for a string, and then generate a sequence of random letters (the length of the sequence should be the same as the user's string) until he falls on the user's string. At each iteration, the program can compare his random string to the user's string, and keep the right letters.
