### Exercise (medium)
Given this list: 
`[825, 262, 627, 826, 285, 221, 730, 340, 750, 989, 272, 842, 383, 575, 810]`  
Use the [python built in list methods](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list) to print:  

-  The number of elements in the list
-  The minimum element in the list
-  The maximum element in the list
-  The sum of all the numbers in the list

### Exercise (medium)
Take this list: `['spring', 'autumn', 'summer']`.  
Add `winter` at the end of the list.  
Swap `autumn` and `summer`.  


### Exercise (medium)

We are given a list of 10 integers to analyze. Repeat the questions below with the following lists of numbers: 

- [3, 47, 99, -80, 22, 97, 54, -23, 5, 7] 
- [44, 9l, 8, 24, -6, 0, 56, 8, 100, 2] 
- [3, 21, 76, 53, 9, -82, -3, 49, 1, 76] 
- [18, 19, 2, 56, 33, 17, 41, -63, -82, 1]

1. Store the list of numbers in a variable.

2.  We will now print some information about the list of numbers. Each time, print the answer together with a helpful message that tells the user what you are printing.

3.  Print the following information: 

   a. The list of numbers – printed in a single line 

   b. The list of numbers – sorted in descending order (largest to smallest) 

   c. The sum of all the numbers

4. A list containing the first and the last numbers only 

5.  (Bonus: The average of all the numbers) 

6. (Bonus: The largest number) 

7.  (Bonus: The smallest number) 


### Exercise (medium)

1. Find an interesting paragraph of text online. (Please keep it appropriate to the social context of our class.) 
2. Paste it into your code, and store it as a variable. 
3. Let’s analyze the paragraph. Print out a nicely formatted message saying: 
   1. How many characters it contains (this one is easy...) 
   2. How many sentences it contains 
   3. How many words it contains 
   4. How many unique words it contains 
   5. (Bonus: How many non-whitespace characters it contains) 
   6. (Bonus: The average amount of words per sentence in the paragraph) 
   7. (Bonus: the amount of non-unique words in the paragraph)


### Exercise (hard)
Reminder:  
A list element can be any data type, thus it can also be a list. For example, a list of lists, where each sub list contains a name and an age:

```python
my_family = [['John', 14], ['Micheal', 18], ['Dorit', 20]]
```
***
Create a list of your 3 favorites actors, this list should be a list of lists, each sub list is in this format: `[actor_name, reason_you_like_him]`.  
Use this list to print something like this:
```python
My favourite actors are:
Homer Simpsons, because he is so funny.
Johnny Depp, because he acts so good.
Me, because it's me.
```

### Exercise (hard)
Ask the user to give you the four seasons, separated by a space.  
Use [python strings methods](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string) to put each word in a list. And then check if this list has really 4 seasons.
