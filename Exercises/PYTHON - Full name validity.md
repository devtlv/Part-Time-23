### Full name validity 
Ask the user for his full name (example: "John Doe"), and check the validity of his answer:

-  The name should contain only letters.
-  The name should contain only one space.
-  The first letter of each name should be upper cased.

### Spaces
Ask the user for a sentence, and then tell him how many words are in it.
