## Organisation

### Version control
- Learn git (not necessarily with github), use it to manage your project

### Working in team

**Communication**  
 
Coding is not just about coding. It's also about talking with people, whether if is to ask a question or to work on the same code, you need to be able to explain your program/problem. The rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging in which a programmer would carry arround a rubber duck and explain his code to it, line by line. Explaining your code is an important skill to developp, it also makes you better at visualizing abstract concepts.  


**Documentation**  
Documenting your code is another really important skill to have as a developper, it makes your code cleanier and so more understandable (for you and for the others). Put in-line comments, create doc string for classes and functions.  

**How to write in line comments:**  
In line comments can have different verbose levels. Basically, comments should answer:
- *What* are you doing ?
- *Why* are you doing it ?
- *How* is it working ?  

For simple block of codes, a *What* comment is enough. *What* and *Why* fit for more complicated lines, and explaining *how* is important for complex block of codes.

**Sharing code**   
Learn working version control platforms like github or bitbucket, it's a really powerful tool to work in team, but try to learn git before.  
 

## Knowledge

### How to improve

- Where to improve

Identifying your weaknesses is the first step to fix them. Pay attention to frequent errors, and try to have them in mind when you're working.   
Learn every thing you feel unsafe about.   
Try to think about what do you want to do, then try to extend your knowledge in this domain.   

- Don't build while learning, don't learn while building
 
Split your time in two phases:  

The Learn phase, where you should focus on amassing knowledge. Read books, complete every tutorial and explore what’s already been done.  

The Build phase, where you create something by applying the knowledge gained in the previous phase. Stop doubting your skills, tune out the noise that says you can’t and write your own app. Only when you’re done, go back and learn again.  

- Make mistakes

Don't be afraid to make mistakes, just be sure to learn from them. 


### How not to improve

**Think that you know enough**  

Even Eyal doesn't know enough, developpers never stop learning.

**Watching "6 simple secrets to become a senior developper in one month" videos**  

Amassing knowledge takes time, learn slowly, one thing at the time, without rushing, trust me, there is no secret.
  
**Do the least you can**  

Try to understand the things you use, the more in depth you can.

**Think you're not good enough**  

You are.


## Become a better developper

#### Coding knowledge
**Strengthen python basics:**
- Data Structures
- OOPs concepts
- Variables and data types
- File handling concepts
- Exception Handling
- Generators
- Iterators

**Learn other developper skills:**
- Debugging
- Regular expressions


**Learn about known librairies**
- collections
- os
- threading
- itertools/functools
- requests
- matplotlib
- wxpython/tkinter
- scrapy
- django
- pytest

**Get into close domains:**  
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript
- Databases
- OS
- Performance
- Security

#### Code design
**KISS: Keep it simple, stupid.**  

At the beginning, don't try to make beautiful/effective/compact code, just make something that work.  
 
**Start things from the very beginnin**  

Don't copy paste too much, do it a couple of times, it will help you create automatisms.

#### Experience
**Interact with other developers**  

Better developers will give you a lot of techniques/tools that you never think about. Give other beginners advices, try to help them or to discuss their code with them.  

**Read code and learn techniques, not tools**  

Reading code will help you a lot discovering new techniques, new way to do things. Take a block of code, understand it, then ask yourself how you would do it, and why, is your way better than his one ? What can you learn from this ?  

**Code for fun**  
Coding is also a passion for most of us, don't only think about the money, coding for fun is the best way to become a really good developper in a few time.
 
## Use internet
**Ask the right questions**  
At the beginning it's really hard to ask the right questions, and to type the right thing on google, but don't worry, nobody was born good at this.  

**Read documentations**   
Reading a documentation is also something that is really difficult for a beginner, you will spend a lot of time just searching something, but.. again.. it's just a matter of experience.  

**Watch python talks (Pycon)**   
Get interested into python news, watch talks.  

**Explore the source code of your favorite python package**   
It's like reading other's code, but this time you're sure he is better than yours.

**Contribute to an open source project**   
If you want to code for fun in the evening but you don't know what to do, try to contribute to an open source project.  


## The next step
**Write it three times**  
After getting able to write a code that work, you need to learn how to create a code that works right, most of the times you will write your code three times:  
- First, you write the software to prove to yourself (or a client) that the solution is possible. Others may not recognize that this is just a proof-of-concept, but you do.
- The second time, you make it work.
- The third time, you make it work right.

**Learn another programming language**   
Every language has his own purpose, learn another one that completes your work with python.


## Be proud of yourself

You learnt a pretty complicated thing, be proud of yourself.   
Bravo.
