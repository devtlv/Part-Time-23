# Abstract lesson - Loops and Conditions

#### Life is made of simple things

People's life can be resumed with four things:
-  Environnement
-  Tasks  
-  Routines
-  Choices  

#### Environnement
The environnement is, by definition, the actual state or everything (it includes you). People's tasks and choices are highly influenced by their environnement.  
In computer sciences, environnement is defined by variables. The program will act differently if you change them, like people's life would have been different in a different environnement. 

#### Tasks
Everyone's life is composed of a lot of tasks: *breath*, *eat*, *write*, etc...  
In programming, tasks correspond to operations, for example: *print*, *add*, *compare*, etc..


#### Routines
Most of the times, those tasks are repeated, everyone breath all the time, the *breath* task is repeated indefinitely. In programming, this is called a loop.   

There are two different types of repetitions:  
The first one is a typical work day: *work until hour is 19:00*, the *work* task is repeated until a certain condition (*hour is 19:00*) is reached.  
This represents the programming *While Loop*.  

The second one is for example a book signing session at the books store, the writer sit on a table, each one gives him his book and he signs it. The same task (*Sign the book*) is repeated for each person present.  
This represents the programing *For loop*.


#### Choices
Choices also rule our life's actions, we're all the time testing things and react accordingly. For example, when driving, we are testing the *Traffic light is red* statement, and if it is, we stop.  
Programs are also ruled by a lot of *conditions*.

#### Conclusion
Actually, programs are very similar to life, they are mainly ruled by four things:
- Variables
- Operations
- Loops
- Conditions
