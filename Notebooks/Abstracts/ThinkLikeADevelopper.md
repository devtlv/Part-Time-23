# Thinking Like a Developer

### Rule 1: Resist the temptation to jump into code
Before jumping into code, take a paper and think how you should do it.  

### Rule 2: Inspect your code by hand
When your code isn't working, run it manually, line by line, and you will find out where the problem is.  

### Rule 3: Refer to code that you haven’t written yet
When writing some code, you sometimes need to call something you didn't programmed yet, it's ok, just refer to it as it was already written, and add a TODO comment.  

### Rule 4: Coding in reverse
When you need to start a project, start at the end, when it all comes together, this helps you to identify the pieces that you need, now branch off and build each piece.  

### Rule 5: The plastic duck
Explain your code to a plastic duck, explain each step, what it does and how, you will do much less errors.  

### Rule 6: “Start small; keep it working” 
Hard-code values for yourself to save time while developing and testing.

### Rule 7: Test your code
Check that your code acts as expected in all cases, test your code with a few ‘correct’/’normal’ options, and then with abnormal options, find out which options produce errors and why.
